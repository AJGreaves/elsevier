# Elsevier
_A one page web app for use at conferences, to demo medical study learning environment and collect emails for newsletter._

3 multiple choice questions and a signup form for the Elsevier newsletter.

- Include progress bar if possible. It will be only three questions though. I will check again with the client if this is a 'must have'
- After Q3 answer is shown, pressing 'next' can just go to a thank you/sign up form
- Data to be collected from user: First name, Last name, email address
- Store data: Either use EmailJS to send individual emails, or user Firebase.
- Waiting for brand colours, images, fonts etc that need replicating from client. 
- Web app will be an iPad and/or a lower/mid resolution laptop. Mobile responsiveness is not necessary.

### Questions for client:
- "View lab values" link. Do I link this to something? If yes please provide link(s), or should I leave this section and the icon out? 
- Is the "Copy Question" button functionality required? 
    - If yes, do you want a copy of only the question or also the answer?
    - If no, do you want me to leave the icon and text in?
- Is the "Study Mode is ON" button functionality required?
    - If yes, what does it do?
    - If no, do you want me to leave the text and button it and just have it not do anything?
- Waiting for brand colours, images, fonts etc that need replicating.
