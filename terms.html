            <p><span class="bold">Winner Notification and Acceptance:</span>
                The potential winners will be notified on or about

                and non-transferable. Cash will not be awarded in lieu of the prize, but Sponsor
                reserves the right to substitute a prize of equal or greater value due to unavailability. The winner
                is solely responsible for reporting and payment of any federal, state and local taxes and for
                compliance with all laws associated with the use of the prize. The winner may be asked to
                execute and return to Sponsor an affidavit of eligibility and a liability release (except where
                prohibited by law) within fourteen (14) days of attempted notification. Non-compliance within
                that time period or failure to comply with any term or condition of these Official Rules may, at
                the sole discretion of Sponsor, result in a winner's disqualification and the selection of an
                alternate winner. Return of any prize/prize notification as undeliverable will result in
                disqualification and an alternate winner will be selected. All decisions of Sponsor are final and
                binding.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold">Consent to Use of Personal Information:</span>
                Submission of entry constitutes entrant’s consent
                for Sponsor to use entrant’s email address and responses for purposes of marketing and
                promotion of Sponsor’s products and services. By accepting the prize, the winner
                acknowledges compliance with these Official Rules and agrees to permit Sponsor to use the
                winner’s name, hometown and state and institutional affiliation in any media for any commercial,
                advertising, publicity or promotional purpose, without limitation or additional compensation or
                permission, unless prohibited by law or the winner’s institution.

                affiliated companies, nor its advertising or promotional agencies shall have any obligation,
                liability or responsibility for (1) telephone, electronic, hardware, software, network, Internet, or
                computer malfunctions, failures, or difficulties of any kind; (2) any condition caused by events
                beyond the control of Sponsor that may cause the Promotion to be disrupted; (3) any printing
                or typographical errors in these Official Rules or any other materials associated with the
                Promotion; (4) entries that contain incorrect or inaccurate information or do not comply with
                these Official Rules; or (5) entries, prize claims or notifications that are lost, late, incomplete,
                illegible, unintelligible, damaged or otherwise not received by the intended recipient, in whole
                or in part. Sponsor, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to disqualify any entry of any person
                tampering with or abusing the entry process, conduct of the Promotion or otherwise violating
                these Official Rules. Sponsor further reserves the right to cancel, terminate or modify the
                Promotion if it cannot be completed as planned because of tampering, unauthorized
                intervention or technical failures of any sort.
